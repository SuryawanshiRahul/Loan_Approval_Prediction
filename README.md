Loan Approval Prediction
Overview:

The Loan Approval Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. This project utilizes a variety of data features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant factors to make informed predictions. The goal is to assist financial institutions in automating and enhancing their loan approval processes.
